# Godot-logo

My first custom animated Godot logo, just for fun ...and my future games.
No used shaders or post-processing FX, just light, texture,... nodes.

The main script is LogoGodot.gd (with main scene LogoGodot.tscn). The code isn't clear but not long, I hope anyone will understand.
If you wanna use this scene in own game, please put the link to this folder into credit info of your game.
